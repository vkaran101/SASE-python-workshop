# SASE-python-workshop

This repository contains all of the information from a workshop I recently taught with Northeastern SASE. Check out the powerpoint
to learn more about how your computer works, and how a program is run. Learn how to code using Python!

For the workshop, I taught attendees how to build a simple Python script using the Tweepy; a python library to access the Twitter API.
The program populates a user's twitter timeline, gets followers, and listens for live tweets regarding a certain trend.

Will be updated soon!
